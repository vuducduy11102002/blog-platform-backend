Instructions for testing http backend

I should categorize the requests by resource (Articles, Comments) and then by HTTP method (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE). For each request, I need to specify:

HTTP Method: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
Endpoint URL: e.g., http://localhost:5000/api/articles
Headers: Content-Type: application/json for POST and PUT requests
Body (if needed): Provide example JSON body for POST and PUT requests.
Expected Response Status Code: e.g., 200 for success, 201 for created, 400 for bad request, 404 for not found, 500 for server error.
I will create Postman collections or instructions that cover the following endpoints:

Article Endpoints:

POST /api/articles: Create a new article
GET /api/articles: Get all articles
GET /api/articles/{id}: Get article by ID
PUT /api/articles/{id}: Update article
DELETE /api/articles/{id}: Delete article
POST /api/articles/{id}/like: Like/Unlike article
GET /api/articles/{id}/suggestions: Get suggested articles
Comment Endpoints:

POST /api/comments/articles/{articleId}: Create comment for article
GET /api/comments/articles/{articleId}: Get comments for article
DELETE /api/comments/{commentId}: Delete comment
User Endpoint (example):

GET /api/users/profile: Get user profile (though this one is basic)
For ease of use, I will provide instructions on how to set up each request in Postman, including screenshots or clear steps would be ideal, but for text-based format, clear step by step is essential. I should also mention the environment setup if needed (e.g., setting MONGODB_URI and PORT as environment variables in Postman, although .env file is used in the code directly). However, it is better to stick to instructions assuming the backend server is running on http://localhost:5000.

Let's organize the instructions clearly, resource by resource, and method by method.

2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental. Lacks access to real-time info and some Gemini features.
Okay, let's outline how to test your backend API using Postman. I'll provide step-by-step instructions for each endpoint, including the request type, URL, headers, body (if needed), and expected response.

Assumptions:

Your backend server is running on http://localhost:5000.
You have Postman installed.
You have some basic understanding of how to use Postman.
Postman Setup Instructions for Each Endpoint:

We'll organize the tests by resource: Articles, Comments, and Users (though the user endpoint is very basic in the current code).

A. Testing Article Endpoints:

Create Article (POST /api/articles)

Method: POST
URL: http://localhost:5000/api/articles
Headers:
Content-Type: application/json
Body: raw and JSON format
JSON

{
    "title": "Test Article Title from Postman",
    "content": "# Heading 1\nThis is a test article created via Postman to verify the POST endpoint."
}
Send the request.
Expected Response:
Status Code: 201 Created
Body: The newly created article object, including an _id generated by MongoDB. Save this _id value somewhere (like a notepad or Postman environment variable) as you'll need it for subsequent tests (GET, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
Get All Articles (GET /api/articles)

Method: GET
URL: http://localhost:5000/api/articles
Headers: None needed.
Body: None.
Send the request.
Expected Response:
Status Code: 200 OK
Body: An array of article objects. You should see the article you just created in the previous step, along with any other articles in your database.
Get Article by ID (GET /api/articles/{id})

Method: GET
URL: http://localhost:5000/api/articles/YOUR_ARTICLE_ID
Replace YOUR_ARTICLE_ID with the _id you saved from the "Create Article" test.
Headers: None needed.
Body: None.
Send the request.
Expected Response:
Status Code: 200 OK
Body: The specific article object corresponding to the ID you provided.
Update Article (PUT /api/articles/{id})

Method: PUT
URL: http://localhost:5000/api/articles/YOUR_ARTICLE_ID
Replace YOUR_ARTICLE_ID with the same ID used in the "Get Article by ID" test.
Headers:
Content-Type: application/json
Body: raw and JSON format
JSON

{
    "title": "Updated Test Article Title via Postman",
    "content": "# Updated Heading 1\nThis article has been updated using the PUT request from Postman."
}
Send the request.
Expected Response:
Status Code: 200 OK
Body: The updated article object. Verify that the title and content are updated as per your request body.
Delete Article (DELETE /api/articles/{id})

Method: DELETE

URL: http://localhost:5000/api/articles/YOUR_ARTICLE_ID

Replace YOUR_ARTICLE_ID with the same ID used in the previous tests.
Headers: None needed.

Body: None.

Send the request.

Expected Response:

Status Code: 200 OK
Body: A message like {"message": "Article deleted"}.
Verification: After deleting, try to Get Article by ID (using the same ID). You should now get a 404 Not Found status, confirming the deletion.

Like/Unlike Article (POST /api/articles/{id}/like)

Method: POST

URL: http://localhost:5000/api/articles/YOUR_ARTICLE_ID/like

Make sure you are using an YOUR_ARTICLE_ID of an article that exists. If you deleted the test article, create a new one first.
Headers: None needed.

Body: None (empty body).

Send the request.

Expected Response (First time liking):

Status Code: 200 OK
Body: {"message": "Article liked"}
Send the request again (Unliking): Send the same POST request again.

Expected Response (Second time unliking):

Status Code: 200 OK
Body: {"message": "Article unliked"}
Verification: To check the like count, you can Get Article by ID and look at the likes array length. Remember, currently, it's using a dummy DUMMY_USER_ID, so it's not user-specific liking yet, but the functionality of adding and removing from the likes array is being tested.

Get Suggested Articles (GET /api/articles/{id}/suggestions)

Method: GET
URL: http://localhost:5000/api/articles/YOUR_ARTICLE_ID/suggestions
Replace YOUR_ARTICLE_ID with an existing article ID. For suggestions to work meaningfully, make sure you have multiple articles in your database, ideally with some tags or categories if your suggestion logic uses them.
Headers: None needed.
Body: None.
Send the request.
Expected Response:
Status Code: 200 OK
Body: An array of article objects that are suggested as related to the article with YOUR_ARTICLE_ID. The suggestions are based on the basic logic implemented in articleController.js (similar categories or tags). If you don't have multiple articles with categories/tags, this might return an empty array or very few suggestions.
B. Testing Comment Endpoints:

Create Comment for Article (POST /api/comments/articles/{articleId})

Method: POST
URL: http://localhost:5000/api/comments/articles/YOUR_ARTICLE_ID
Replace YOUR_ARTICLE_ID with an existing article ID (create one if needed).
Headers:
Content-Type: application/json
Body: raw and JSON format
JSON

{
    "text": "This is a test comment posted via Postman."
}
Send the request.
Expected Response:
Status Code: 201 Created
Body: The newly created comment object, including an _id. Save this _id for the delete comment test.
Get Comments for Article (GET /api/comments/articles/{articleId})

Method: GET
URL: http://localhost:5000/api/comments/articles/YOUR_ARTICLE_ID
Use the same YOUR_ARTICLE_ID for which you just created a comment.
Headers: None needed.
Body: None.
Send the request.
Expected Response:
Status Code: 200 OK
Body: An array of comment objects associated with the specified articleId. You should see the comment you just created in the list.
Delete Comment (DELETE /api/comments/{commentId})

Method: DELETE

URL: http://localhost:5000/api/comments/YOUR_COMMENT_ID

Replace YOUR_COMMENT_ID with the _id of the comment you created.
Headers: None needed.

Body: None.

Send the request.

Expected Response:

Status Code: 200 OK
Body: {"message": "Comment deleted"}
Verification: After deleting, try to Get Comments for Article again. The deleted comment should no longer be in the list.

C. Testing User Endpoint (Basic Profile - GET /api/users/profile)

Note: This is a very basic example as user authentication is not implemented in the code provided. This endpoint is just for demonstration in userController.js.

Get User Profile (GET /api/users/profile)

Method: GET
URL: http://localhost:5000/api/users/profile
Headers: None needed.
Body: None.
Send the request.
Expected Response:
Status Code: 200 OK
Body: {"message": "User profile endpoint"} (or whatever message you've set in userController.js). This endpoint is a placeholder and doesn't actually fetch a real user profile without further implementation of user features.
Important Notes for Testing:

Error Handling: These tests mainly check for successful responses (200, 201). To thoroughly test error handling, you should also try sending requests with invalid data (e.g., missing required fields, invalid IDs) and verify that you get appropriate error status codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found, 500 Server Error) and meaningful error messages.
Data Consistency: After running DELETE requests, be mindful that you are actually deleting data from your database. If you want to re-run tests in a clean state, you might need to manually clear out your MongoDB collections or use a testing database.
Authentication (Future): For a real-world application, you would need to add authentication and authorization. Postman is excellent for testing authenticated APIs. You'd typically use techniques like passing JWT tokens in headers to simulate authenticated requests.
Test Automation: For more robust and repeatable testing, consider using a testing framework like Jest or Mocha for backend testing and Cypress or Selenium for frontend end-to-end testing. Postman collections can also be exported and used for basic automated testing and documentation.
By following these Postman instructions, you can systematically test each of your backend API endpoints and ensure they are working as expected. Remember to replace placeholders like YOUR_ARTICLE_ID and YOUR_COMMENT_ID with actual values from your database or from previous test responses.
